    <span class="first-letter">I</span>n the Foundation (Nursery) class, first the children are taught to overcome their anxieties caused by the separation from the comforts and familiar environment of their home. Then, they are taught to adapt the school environment by providing loving, emotional, behavioral and engaging support for learning shape, size, letters, concept word, numbers, singing, dancing and rhythmical activities.<BR />
Children of this level receive information primarily through the audio-visual, tactile and balancing mechanisms within the brain.<br />

The children of Pre-I and Pre-II are taught simple mathematical concepts, four skills of language (listening, speaking, reading and writing skills) both in Nepali and English. They are introduced to modern means of communication and technology. The curriculum of the level focuses on Montessori based activities. Children learn by doing and realize learning is fun. Our teachers play the role of managers, guides, assessors and facilitators.
<br />
The students from Grade I to VIII learn through inquiry based and hands on activities methods that develop high standards of thinking skills and their inquisitiveness. Teachers provide good environment of learning where students opine themselves and build mathematical concepts, learn the four skills of language and use them practically. Science and Social Studies are taught through project based, research based and discovery methods. Children are made closer to modern means of communication and technology. The curriculum of this level focuses on innovative teaching and learning methods. Class based exercises and field trips are carefully planned to maximize learning in all areas to ensure that students acquire the skills of inquiry, observation and experimentation. Studentsâ€™ projects are flexible and cater to multiple intelligence. They are designed to maximize the four skills of Language and Mathematical skills as well. Students get the opportunities to work independently as well as in group activities.
<br />
Grade IX & X are prepared for the SLC examinations. The text books and teaching learning activities are based on the curriculum designed by Curriculum Development Center (CDC) Nepal. Students are taught according to SLC syllabus, the objectives of secondary level, National Education objectives and vision of school education.
<br />
In short, the curriculum of Matribhumi helps the students to be humanitarian in their approach, deft at adaptation, innovative and resourceful at times of crisis, international in their outlook and capable of carving a home for themselves in any global grid.
